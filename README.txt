Hi,

I used SA in my program.
Please use Safari to run my html program.
First, select an image from the examples. (I saved all the example images on my QQ Blog, and the program can get them by the url. Make sure your computer is connected with the Internet.)
Then click “Start” to run the program. And you can also stop and restart the program in the running process by clicking this button.
And if you want to reproduce another image in from examples, please refresh the webpage first.

Thanks.
